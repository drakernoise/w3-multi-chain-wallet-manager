# 💬 Gravity Messenger - User Guide

Gravity Messenger is a real-time, secure, and free chat system that enables communication between community members. It does not require blockchain transactions or gas.

## 🔑 Messenger Identity

Unlike your blockchain wallet, the messenger uses a unique **Username**.
- When joining for the first time, you must choose a name.
- This name is linked to your local extension installation.
- If you change browsers or clear data, you might need to re-register or clear your stalled session.

## 🏠 Rooms and Channels

- **Global Lobby:** A public room where everyone can talk.
- **Public Rooms:** Anyone can join by searching for them by name.
- **Private Rooms:** Invite-only access (🔒). They appear with a lock icon.
- **Direct Messages (DMs):** One-on-one private conversations.

## 🛡️ Moderation (For Room Creators)

If you create a room, you are the **Owner (Owner ☆)** and have management powers:
- **Kick:** Removes a user from the room (they can rejoin if it's public).
- **Ban:** Permanently prevents a user from entering that room.
- **Delete Room:** Permanently removes the room and all its messages.

## 🔔 Notifications and Invitations

When someone invites you to a private room or sends a DM:
- A notification will appear at the top-right of the chat.
- The new room will automatically show up in your sidebar under "Direct Messages" or "Rooms".

## 🚀 Troubleshooting

### "Username already taken"
If the name you chose is already in use, please try another one. Usernames are currently permanent.

### Connection Failed
If you see "Connection Failed", the chat server might be down or your connection blocked. Click **Retry Connection** to try again.

### Stalled Identity
If you have trouble logging in and the server says you are already logged in or there's a registration error, use the **"Clear Stalled Identity"** button on the error screen. This will reset your local chat session.
