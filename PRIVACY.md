# Privacy Policy for Gravity Web3 Wallet

**Last Updated:** December 12, 2025

Gravity ("we", "our", or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how your information is handled when you use the Gravity Web3 Multi-Chain Wallet browser extension.

## 1. Data Collection and Storage

**We do NOT collect, transmit, or store your personal data on our servers.**

*   **Local Storage**: All your sensitive information, including private keys, master passwords, and account names, is stored **locally on your device** using your browser's secure storage capabilities (`chrome.storage.local`).
*   **Encryption**: Your private keys are encrypted using AES-256 encryption with a password that only you know. We do not have access to your password or your keys.

## 2. Network Communication

The extension communicates directly with public blockchain nodes (RPC endpoints) to:
*   Fetch account balances.
*   Broadcast transactions (transfers, votes, etc.).
*   Read public blockchain history.

When you perform these actions, your IP address may be visible to the public RPC node operators (e.g., Hive, Steem, or Blurt nodes), just as it would be if you visited a website. We do not run these nodes and do not intercept this traffic.

## 3. Third-Party Services

Gravity does not integrate with third-party analytics (like Google Analytics) or tracking services.

## 4. Web3 Interaction

When you connect Gravity to a third-party website (dApp):
*   The dApp provides the transaction details.
*   You must actively confirm/sign the transaction in Gravity.
*   Only the signed transaction signature is returned to the dApp. Your private keys are **never** shared with the dApp.

## 5. Changes to This Policy

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.

## 6. Contact Us

If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact the developer via the official repository or support channels.
